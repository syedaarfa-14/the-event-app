    <p className="content">Community events are a great way to meet new people that live close to you. Who knows, 
    you might discover that you’ve been missing out on some great company.<br/><br/>

    But there are many other reasons to host a community event. You could improve the neighbourhood, 
    raise funds for a charity, or celebrate local talent or culture.<br /><br />
    Below are the most popular formats for festive events:
    <ul>
        <li>Devotional Gatherings</li>
        <li>Suprise Event</li>
        <li>Street Parties</li>
        <li>Quiz Nights</li>
